    '''
    Generator Class is the logic of a Sudoku Game. The Class contains the main funkctions of the Sudoku.
    The Generator is build with the fillGrid and the reduceGrid function.
    The Solver function will solve a Sudoku Puzzle and find a possible Solution using a Brute-Force (Backtracking) Algorithm.

    To use the Generator more efficiently our GUI we have the Sudoku function.
